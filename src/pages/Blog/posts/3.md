Nowadays there are lots of social media accounts posting “motivational", “success” quotes, personal trainings to motivate yourself, reach your goals and books to become successful and millionaire. And people make a lot of money on it. If you don’t have a goal they will find you a goal, if you don’t know what you want they will tell you what you want. Have you ever been in such situation like ‘you wanted to learn some new language’? It would be logical if you enrolled to a course related with that. If you don’t have enough money buy books and start self-education or at least watch online lessons. But what we do is watching videos or reading books like ‘how correctly learn spanish’, ‘how to learn english in 10 days’, ‘easiest way to learn new language’. So while you need to learn past tense of irregular verbs you wasting time listenning that ‘precious advices’. If you want to do something just go and do it. You do not need any motivation. By searching motivation you are just procrastinating and procrastinating.

## Types of motivation

• Intrinsic motivation: you do it because you enjoy it. Everything goes to second plan and you are happy while you doing it.
• Extrinsic motivation: all other reasons. When you decide to do something and you think about its result, do you mainly notice its reward, bonuses, punishment? If yes then it is 2nd type of motivation. This feeling come in a form of fear, shame or pride.

• In his presentation on ‘ The Amazing Science of Motivation' Daniel Pink talks about how Professor of psychology at Princeton university Sam Glucksberg used the “Problem with the Candle" coined by Karl Dunker. 2 groups participated to experiment. The first group was asked to solve the problem with a candle to simply measure the average time for such tasks. The second group was offered a money prize to the first 5 who will solve the problem. The result was pretty amazing. The participants in the second group solved this task on average 3.5 minutes longer. Those the promised reward suppressed creative thinking ☺
So modern business, where the ‘involvement' of employees is required, should stop use “motivation for the result" and focus on internal motivation aimed at improving productivity.
