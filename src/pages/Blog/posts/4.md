Firstly, it is my first time writing book reviews and I have no idea how to write it. But I hope that it’ll be helpful and you will want to read some of them. These are some of my favourite books that I wanted to share with you.

## ‘Letters from a Stoic’ Seneca

‘It doesn’t matter how many books you have, but how good the books are wich you have'
If they asked me which one book to read, then my answer would be: only this one. When I started reading Seneca, I was afraid that it would be something too serious and boring. But, as it turned out, all my fears were in vain. Moral letters turned out to be very kind and easy to read, despite the seriousness of the topics discussed. I even got the impression that the letters were addressed to me, and Seneca - my good grandfather, educating and instructing dummy me.

## ‘Siddhartha’ Hermann Hesse

‘Knowledge can be communicated, but not wisdom. One can find it, live it, do wonders through it, but one cannot communicate and teach it’
For me personally, Siddhartha is a book that teaches nothing and does not impose anything, but tells a story that everyone is free to interpret according to his own understanding. This, in my opinion, is the power of Hessian books - he invites us to think on eternal topics with him, without giving any recipes, respecting the mind of his reader.

## ‘Arch of Triumph' Erich Marie Remarque

One of my favourite Remarque’s masterpiece. His books are about real life, about what worries people, about how tragic the life of those who go against the rules can be. Everything is perfect in this book: the psychology of the heroes, the tense atmosphere of pre-war Paris. For me, this story is the one after which I want to live without seeking excuses. If under such circumstances a person is able to rejoice, to live every moment of life and live it with a smile on his face ... Why we can’t?

## ‘The picture of Dorian Gray’ Oscar Wilde

It is a small story, but it certainly will not leave anyone indifferent. Each of us has several personalities. Someone flaunts the best and hides the worst even from himself. Someone does the opposite. Dorian Gray hid his true self in a portrait, away from human eyes. I think this is a sad and haunting book that tells of the joyful naivete of youth and the sad wisdom of maturity.

## ‘The Master and Margarita’ Mikhail Bulgakov

I read it after finishing ‘A country doctor’s notebook' of Bulgakov. And I think I need to read it again after some time. This is the story of love, faith, evils of human and forgiveness. It is a drama, which in some parts is a comedy. The characters and behaviors of the Master and Margarita Nikolaevna make me believe in true and eternal love. Margarita for me is the representation of devotion, pride and courage. I am not able to write a good review for this masterpiece, you must read it yourself.
