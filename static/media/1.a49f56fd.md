# How Our Brain Learns?

Learning is just one of its many tasks. What I am going to elaborate is an incredibly protected thing that most people compare to walnuts. Yes, our brain. How come we remember some things and forget some of them? How do we know that we will use information in the right situation? And more questions that interests many people, but difficult to explain.
Have you ever paid attention after coming home from work how little is left in our mind of most sounds, smells and signboards. Maybe we are not aware of this, but our brain differentiates information that is needed/not needed for us and keeps the needed ones. And to discern the data brain pays attention to its meaning, importance and continuity. Information that is of great importance to us (especially if the result of this information is based on reward or punishment) takes an important place in our memory. Simply, while our brains are not keen on learning information that is of little importance, it is eager to learn significant ones.

- Reward and Punishment in learning

Speaking of reward and punishment lets all recall our memories. Are the things we remember teacher is scolding us for not doing our homework or a perfect summer vacation for a good marks? It is highly probable something like that. “Unfortunately” our brain has some difficulty remembering if there is no reward or punishment or pain or pleasure (whatever you say) at the end.

- Learning and Memory

Learning and memory (storage) are provided by connections called synapses between neurons. The more these connections are and stronger, the more qualitive our learning process is. To deliniate it, we can think of these connections as roads in our brains. The more and better the roads are, the better the information is learned. In other words, learning is a very comprehensive and active process that includes recording, understanding, remembering and using information.
Imagine that you have a beautiful chalet. You wake up in the morning, have breakfast and go out. You’ve gone through the woods and what’s that! A waterfall of undescribable beauty. Amazing! You can’t get enough of watching, but it gets dark and you have to come home. Let’s go back now, to come to this waterfall, you have gone through the woods and made some path. If you do not come to see this waterfall, in a few days your path will be covered with brushwoods. Maybe you won’t find a way when you want to see the waterfall.
What should we do then?

- Memory is Repetition and Reinforcement

We need to pass a way several times so that the story above ends with a happy ending. In that case, the path will be solidified in our memory and next time to reach the waterfall will be much simpler for us.
This is exactly what happens in our brains. When we receive information, we reinforce it with constant repetition, and even make associations, so that we can remember the information very easily and use it whenever it’s necessary. With the learning and repetition process, we obtain that information.
Our brain learns well with both reward or punishment. It is up to you which way to choose.
