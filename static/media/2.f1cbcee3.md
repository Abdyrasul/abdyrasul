‘Thinking’ is the activity of human brain working of various views with the knowledge that has been stored in mind. So that means everything in your mind influence the way you think.
When you say ‘oh I have a great idea' or ‘I have just thought about something’ you take credits for that idea as if you have done hard work in generating them. However in fact, your brain does all work: consodilating memories, trying new combinations, evaluating the consequences before idea rises to your awareness. So the more information stored in our brain the more combinations can be created and that enhances wide thinking capacity. Every finished book, every watched film and every trip somehow affect our thoughts. And thoughts become our reality.
‘Silence serves as the foundation of creativity'

To explain this great quote scientifically I found one interesting picture from my biophysics textbook:

On picture above is a PET of a human brain. Places that appear red are the active part of brain while it is doing different activities. So we can clearly see that thinking promote the highest brain activity. However when we speak only little area which is responsible for speaking is active. So here is another saying ‘think before you speak’. Because you wouldn’t have chance to think while you are talking. (only unconscious thinking is active like which word to use, making up sentence,grammar rules etc.) We need to use our thinking ability more. Do not just read a book and pass it. Think about it: what was idea of book, is there something you disagree, what did you learn from it… Learn to develop your own independent opinion. Only your unique thought will create a great ideas.
